This is a porting of the SQLi detection tool [libinjection](https://github.com/client9/libinjection) to Java.

So far it's been tested on around 85,000 SQLi input collected from the original libinjection library [here](https://github.com/client9/libinjection/tree/master/data), with results matching those
 of the original libinjection. Speed-wise similar to the original project (performance climbs as JVM optimizes).
