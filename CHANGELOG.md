# OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) CHANGELOG

## 4.2.2 (2023-11-02)

### Feature

Data Source

- Support MySQL data source
- Adapted to OceanBase 4.2.0/4.2.1
- Data sources add initialization scripts and customized JDBC connection parameter settings

Data Desensitization

- Support view desensitization

DLM

- Support OceanBase 4.x version
- Support MySQL to OceanBase link
- Support white screen current limiting configuration

### Improve

- Optimized object management performance in large-scale table scenarios, and used ob-sql-parser to parse index/constraint metadata
- Optimized database object tree interaction, the project and data source selection interaction area is folded to the top, and the database list is displayed more clearly
- Optimized the interaction between creating a new SQL window and switching databases in the SQL window. Switching databases is faster, and the SQL window adds a copy operation.
- Optimized the data desensitization configuration interaction, making it more convenient to select sensitive columns
- Optimized the problem of slow retrieval of data source list and slow retrieval of data source status in scenarios where there are a large number of data sources.
- Optimize the error text when running PL with wrong parameters

### Fix

PL Debugging

- Unable to jump into sub-stored procedures/functions defined in the package during debugging

SQL Execution

- Continuous execution of "DROP PACKAGE" statements during SQL execution resulted in a large number of error reports
- When connecting to the OceanBase MySQL tenant, the "obodc_procedure_feature_test" stored procedure is automatically called, resulting in an error or slow connection.
- The sum of the time consumption of each sub-item in SQL execution time-consuming statistics is not equal to the parent item
- In the SQL execution time-consuming statistics, "SQL pre-check" and "SQL post-check" lack detailed sub-item time-consuming statistics

SQL-Check

- When creating type under the OceanBase Oracle tenant, if the sub-stored procedure/function has no parameter list, SQL Check will report a syntax error.
- Unable to turn off "Syntax Error" rule

Data Desensitization

- Desensitization fails when the SELECT statement contains multiple table JOINs
- Sensitive columns cannot be recognized in the case-sensitive OceanBase MySQL mode, causing desensitization to fail.

Database Object Management

- Users without the show create view permission will receive an error when viewing view details.
- The length of all character types cannot be displayed when viewing table objects
- Failed to view details of scheduled database change tasks with automatic rollback nodes in personal space

Database Changes

- The database change task timeout setting is invalid

Import and Export

- The exported package in Oracle mode does not contain the package body
- Unable to export result set containing tab characters to Excel

Operational audit

- Changes to "SQL Check Specification" and "SQL Window Specification" are not included in the operational audit scope

### Dependency library upgrade

- Upgrade ob-loader-dumper version to 4.2.5-RELEASE
- Upgrade oceanbase-client version to 2.4.5

### Security reinforcement

- Transmission of sensitive fields on the front and back ends uses asymmetric encryption

## 4.2.1 (2023-09-25)

### Fix

SQL Execution

- Unable to print DBMS output when OceanBase is older than 4.0
- DML statement generation is slow when editing result sets

Import & Export

- Import/export objects are not displayed in task details during task execution

PL Debugging

- When OceanBase is deployed on multiple nodes, PL debugging occasionally fails to connect to the database
- Obtaining database connection errors when debugging anonymous blocks under OceanBase Oracle mode lowercase schema

Datasource management

- An error occurs when the flashback statement generated by the recycle bin module for the index is executed
- The session management interface cannot display the SQL being executed by the session
- A null pointer exception occurs when there are empty rows or columns in the template file during batch import connections

Data desensitization

- When the OceanBase MySQL schema is configured as case-sensitive, sensitive columns cannot be case-sensitive

Work order management

- After the work order is submitted, the work order status remains "queued" for a long time and is not updated and the work order does not report an error

Third party integration

- When the approval flow does not contain an external approval node, it will also try to obtain the ID of the external approval work order

SQL-Check

- OceanBase Oracle mode cannot detect whether table or column comments exist

### Security reinforcement

- Address possible SSRF attacks during third-party integration
