## 4.3.0 (2024-06-07)


Table Objects

- Added support for OceanBase Oracle mode GIS data type
- Added support for OceanBase v4.3.0 columnar storage, including table storage mode and index storage mode 

Change Risk Control

- Added multi-database change tasks, which, compared to database change tasks, support configuring change pipelines when initiating tasks. The pipeline supports multiple batches, with each batch supporting multiple databases, and the pipeline can be saved as a change order template.
- Added database administrators. Project administrators can configure database administrators for the libraries within the project. Database administrators can be referenced in the ticket approval process and their information will also be included in WebHook events for external approval integration.
- Added support for configuring manual execution when initiating tickets, to prevent tasks approved for automatic execution from occurring at unexpected times. 

Data Archiving/Cleaning

- Data cleaning/archiving provides commonly used task metrics, including start time, end time, filtering conditions, processed rows, scanned rows, and real-time performance
- Data cleaning/archiving supports partition conditions
- Data cleaning/archiving supports configuring execution timeout. If the execution time exceeds the set timeout, the task will abort to ensure high-performance database during peak business periods.
- Data archiving supports incremental structural synchronization. When the structure of the source table changes, the task will automatically synchronize the table structure. When enabling structural synchronization, customized synchronization of partitions and indexes can be defined
- Data cleaning/archiving has implemented compatibility with OceanBase MySQL mode field types, adding support for additional field types: bit, set, enum, and spatial data types
- Data cleaning/archiving has implemented compatibility with OceanBase Oracle mode field types, adding support for additional field types: BINARY_FLOAT, BINARY_DOUBLE, TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE, INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH, INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND, ROW, ROWID, UROWID, and BLOB
- Data cleaning supports linkage historical library verification 

Global Object Search

- Added global object retrieval, supporting global search within the project scope, allowing instant access even with numerous library tables
- Supports almost all objects, including libraries, tables, columns, views, functions, stored procedures, program packages, triggers, etc.
- Supports the shortcut key Ctrl/Cmd+J for quick access to global object retrieval

- New Oracle data source with support for SQL development, import/export, data masking, object management, change approval
- New Doris data source with support for SQL development, import/export, data masking, table object management, session management, command-line window, change approval

SQL Development

- 71 common O&M snippets built-in, which can auto-complete in the SQL window and will match database type and version
- SQL auto-completion supports completing data dictionary/performance view
- Case sensitivity for schema names, table names, and column names in Oracle mode now consistent with PL/SQL Developer behavior

Schema Comparison

- New Schema Comparison feature added, supporting Schema Comparisons for homogenous databases (OBOracle, OBMySQL, MySQL)
- Supported scope includes table objects, with comparison properties including columns, primary keys, constraints, indexes, partitions, table properties
- Schema Comparison results provide DIFF preview and change script preview
- SQL preview results are downloadable and can directly initiate schema synchronization tasks

Online Schema Changes

- Support for adding intermediate columns to tables
- Support for concurrent index changes during table schema modifications (OceanBase Oracle mode)
- Support for primary key deletion when the table contains unique constraints (OceanBase Oracle mode)

Partitioning Plan

- Support for configuring partitioning plan for databases in OBOracle mode
- Partition field types not only support DATE/TIMESTAMP but also NUMBER/CHAR/VARCHAR2 and other field types

obclient integration

- Repeated creation of operating system users with the same name results in error reports

Tickets

- Creating a ticket takes too long
- There is a "Pending Approval" ticket for another project in the "Pending Approval" ticket list

Operation record

- The "Data Source" column in the operation record is empty
- SQL execution events are not logged
- Open SQL window event is not logged

### Improve

- Improve SQL execution performance and reduce unnecessary time-consuming operations
- Allow users to configure the maximum number of retries and account lockout time in the event of login failure
- Only allow users to modify table data with primary key constraints, unique key constraints and rowid with a blank screen
- Optimize the error text when synchronizing database errors

### Dependency database upgrade

- Upgrade obclient version to 2.2.4
- Upgrade spring security version to 5.7.10
- Upgrade hutool version to 5.8.23
- Upgrade pf4j version to 3.10.0
- Upgrade netty version to 4.1.94.FINAL

## 4.2.2 bp (2023-11-23)

### Bug fixes

Data archiving

- After the data archiving subtask starts running, updating the current limiter configuration cannot take effect.
- Data cleaning task is not running

data masking

- Entering malicious identification rules in the scenario of automatic scanning of sensitive columns will result in a denial of service by regular expressions

SQL execution

- Display NUMBER type data in scientific notation in MySQL mode

PL run

- Unable to view the contents of the cursor

SQL-Check

- When the database does not report syntax errors, SQL-Check will still prompt syntax errors.

## 4.2.2 (2023-11-07)

### Feature

Data Source

- Support MySQL data source
- Adapted to OceanBase 4.2.0/4.2.1
- Data sources add initialization scripts and customized JDBC connection parameter settings

data masking

- Support view desensitization

DLM

- Support OceanBase 4.x version
- Support MySQL to OceanBase link
- Support white screen current limiting configuration
- Support breakpoint recovery

Import and Export

- Supports import and export of type objects

### Improve

- Optimized object management performance in large-scale table scenarios, and used ob-sql-parser to parse index/constraint metadata
- Optimized database object tree interaction, the project and data source selection interaction area is folded to the top, and the database list is displayed more clearly
- Optimized the interaction between creating a new SQL window and switching databases in the SQL window. Switching databases is faster, and the SQL window adds a copy operation.
- Optimized the data masking configuration interaction, making it more convenient to select sensitive columns
- Optimized the problem of slow retrieval of data source list and slow retrieval of data source status in scenarios where there are a large number of data sources.
- Optimize the error text when running PL with wrong parameters

### Bug fixes

PL Debugging

- Unable to jump into sub-stored procedures/functions defined in the package during debugging

SQL Execution

- Continuous execution of "DROP PACKAGE" statements during SQL execution resulted in a large number of error reports
- When connecting to the OceanBase MySQL tenant, the "obodc_procedure_feature_test" stored procedure is automatically called, resulting in an error or slow connection.
- The sum of the time consumption of each sub-item in SQL execution time-consuming statistics is not equal to the parent item
- In the SQL execution time-consuming statistics, "SQL pre-check" and "SQL post-check" lack detailed sub-item time-consuming statistics

SQL-Check

- When creating type under the OceanBase Oracle tenant, if the sub-stored procedure/function has no parameter list, SQL Check will report a syntax error.
- Unable to turn off "Syntax Error" rule

data masking

- Desensitization fails when the SELECT statement contains multiple table JOINs
- Sensitive columns cannot be recognized in the case-sensitive OceanBase MySQL mode, causing desensitization to fail.

Database Object Management

- Users without the show create view permission will receive an error when viewing view details.
- The length of all character types cannot be displayed when viewing table objects
- Failed to view details of scheduled database change tasks with automatic rollback nodes in personal space

Database Changes

- The database change task timeout setting is invalid

Import and Export

- The exported package in Oracle mode does not contain the package body
- Unable to export result set containing tab characters to Excel

Operational audit

- Changes to "SQL Check Specification" and "SQL Window Specification" are not included in the operational audit scope

### Dependency database upgrade

- Upgrade ob-loader-dumper version to 4.2.5-RELEASE
- Upgrade oceanbase-client version to 2.4.5

### Security reinforcement

- Transmission of sensitive fields on the front and back ends uses asymmetric encryption

## 4.2.1 (2023-09-25)

### Bug fixes

SQL Execution

- Unable to print DBMS output when OceanBase is older than 4.0
- DML statement generation is slow when editing result sets

Import & Export

- Import/export objects are not displayed in task details during task execution

PL Debugging

- When OceanBase is deployed on multiple nodes, PL debugging occasionally fails to connect to the database
- Obtaining database connection errors when debugging anonymous blocks under OceanBase Oracle mode lowercase schema

Datasource management

- An error occurs when the flashback statement generated by the recycle bin module for the index is executed
- The session management interface cannot display the SQL being executed by the session
- A null pointer exception occurs when there are empty rows or columns in the template file during batch import connections

data masking

- When the OceanBase MySQL schema is configured as case-sensitive, sensitive columns cannot be case-sensitive

ticket management

- After the ticket is submitted, the ticket status remains "queued" for a long time and is not updated and the ticket does not report an error

Third party integration

- When the approval flow does not contain an external approval node, it will also try to obtain the ID of the external approval ticket

SQL-Check

- OceanBase Oracle mode cannot detect whether table or column comments exist

### Security reinforcement

- Address possible SSRF attacks during third-party integration
