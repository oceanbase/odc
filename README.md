## 🚀 Installation and Deployment 

ODC comes in two distinct forms: the dynamic Web version and the efficient Desktop version. Let's take a closer look at these offerings:

- **Desktop Version**: Effortless Individual Development 

    The Desktop version is designed for personal development scenarios, offering an efficient and user-friendly SQL development tool. Supported operating systems include Windows and MacOS.

- **Web Version**: Unleash Collaborative Power 

    The Web version caters to multi-person collaborative development scenarios, encompassing collaborative development, risk control, data security, and more. It serves as an integrated platform for database development, management, and control. The Web version provides various installation mediums, such as rpm and Docker images, supporting x86 and ARM architectures. It also encapsulates all the features of SQL development in the Desktop version.

### Deploying the Web Version

Please note that the deployment steps outlined in this section are meant for experiencing the functionality. For production environment deployment, please refer to the [Deployment Guide](https://github.com/oceanbase/odc-doc/blob/V4.2.0/en-US/1100.deployment-guide/100.deployment-overview.md).


#### Before You Start

The ODC Web version is packaged as a Docker image and relies on an OceanBase MySQL tenant as MetaDB. If you have not had a MetaDB, please follow **(Optional) Step 1: Create a MetaDB** below for instructions.

Before you start, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

- Docker is installed and the service is up and running. It is recommended to use the latest version of Docker.
- The deployment machine for ODC has at least 2 available CPU cores and 4 GB of RAM.
- The MetaDB requires a minimum specification of 1 vCPU and 4 GB of RAM.


#### (Optional) Step 1: Create a MetaDB

Use the sample script below to create a MetaDB if you do not already have one. To create a MetaDB, it would require an OceanBase cluster and a test tenant, which the script would also complete for you. The creation process may take about 2 minutes.

Please note that the deployment machine for the OceanBase cluster should have at least 4 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM.

This script is for demo purposes only. If you have already had a MetaDB, please skip this step.

```shell
# Start an OceanBase cluster, which would automatically create a test tenant.
docker run -p 2881:2881 --name oceanbase-ce -d oceanbase/oceanbase-ce

# Connect to the test tenant within the cluster.
docker exec -it oceanbase-ce ob-mysql root

# Create a database user 'odc' and schema 'odc_metadb' within the tenant. Replace <password> with the actual password of your choice.
CREATE USER odc IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
CREATE DATABASE odc_metadb;
GRANT ALL ON odc_metadb.* TO odc;
```


#### Step 2: Launch the ODC Server

Use the script below to launch the ODC Docker container.

```shell
# Launch ODC Server. The following example limits the container to 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of memory.

# Replace <your_metadb_password> with the actual password of your MetaDB. If you have followed Step 1 above to create the MetaDB, then replace <your_metadb_password> with the password you set in Step 1.

# Set the initial password for your admin account of ODC using the parameter <your_admin_password>. This password would be the one you use to log into the ODC Web. The password must satisfy the following requirements:
# - At least 2 digits
# - At least 2 lowercase letters
# - At least 2 uppercase letters
# - At least 2 special characters: ._+@#$%
# - No spaces or other special characters
# - 8~32 characters in length

# The process to launch ODC may take about 2 minutes.

 docker run -d -it --name odc --network host \
 --cpu-period 100000 --cpu-quota 200000 --memory=4G \
 -e "DATABASE_HOST=127.0.0.1" -e "DATABASE_PORT=2881" -e "DATABASE_NAME=odc_metadb" \
 -e "DATABASE_USERNAME=odc@test" -e "DATABASE_PASSWORD=<your_metadb_password>" \
 -e "ODC_ADMIN_INITIAL_PASSWORD=<your_admin_password>" \
 -e "ODC_SERVER_PORT=8989" \
 oceanbase/odc:latest
```
