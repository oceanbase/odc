/**
 * RELY and NORELY are valid only when you are modifying an existing constraint (that is, in the
 * ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY constraint syntax). These parameters specify whether a constraint in
 * NOVALIDATE mode is to be taken into account for query rewrite. Specify RELY to activate an
 * existing constraint in NOVALIDATE mode for query rewrite in an unenforced query rewrite integrity
 * mode. The constraint is in NOVALIDATE mode, so Oracle does not enforce it. The default is NORELY.
